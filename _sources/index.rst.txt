Automatic Conformance Checking Insights in Celonis documentation
================================================================

The 'Automatic Conformance Checking Insights in Celonis' project provides a web application for automatic conformance checking techniques.
It uses the Celonis platform to analyze and pre-process event logs.
It provides insights into the conformance of processes by offering declarative-based, log skeleton-based, temporal, and resource-based conformance checking techniques.
The term 'automatic' stems from the fact that the application automatically computes the insights, without the need for the user to manually upload a process model.
